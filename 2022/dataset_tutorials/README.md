# 16S and shotgun metagenomics datasets

We've also included a couple simple notebooks in this directory to give an overview of the contents of the David dataset (16s) and the Kostic dataset (shotgun metagenomics). The 16S dataset is processed with Dada2, an optional tutorial for which is given in this course module [here](https://github.com/gerberlab/cs109b-microbiome/tree/main/2022/optional_DADA_2_tutorial). Information and tutorials on MetaPhlan can be found on the Huttenhower lab webpage [here](https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/metaphlan/).
