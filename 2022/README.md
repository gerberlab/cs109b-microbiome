TODO: (readme) [GU]

- Introduce structure of this folder

For more details on the datasets you can read [MITRE]() and [MDITRE]() paper but here are the datasets


Each dataset is organized as follows -> so folder structure


- Dataset 1 (link)
  - description amplicon vs shotgun
  - description

- Dataset 2 (link)


We alos have a folder going into the detail of how amplicon sequencing data is analyzed and converted into ASV (ASVs) in the folder [add me]



TODO: (slides) remove laterr
- one slide on shotgun [TG]
- slides on contextualizing interpretability [GU+GG]
- hand making features (time windows, slopes, averages, collapsing bug, phylogeny(long sequences), taxonomy, raw (short sequence) [TG and GG and GU]
- 4->5 slides on datasets [GU]
- MDITRE example
- add code example showing multindexes for fast taxonomy collapsing [TG]
- working with neweck files both slides and jupyter notebooks
- at least one jupyter notebook for one set of data maybe ultimately one for each
